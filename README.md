# 100_days_of_loops
A hundred days of loop studies.

I am attempting my fourth hundred days project. This one is [100 Days Of Loop Studies](https://blog.hellagrapes.club/loop-study-000-what-are-loop-studies/). Currently working primarily with GraphViz and Python - for now, GraphViz sketches are written in [SketchViz](https://sketchviz.com) and saved as  `.txt` files, since I haven't found a satisfactory solution for a local live editor.

Join me in the eternal spiral.
